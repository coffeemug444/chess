what is the definition of a legal move?


1. Pieces can only move in their own directions (ie. bishops move diagonally, rooks move on the ranks and files, etc.)
2. Pieces cannot capture pieces of their own colour
3. Pieces (except knights) cannot move through other pieces
4. Castling cannot occur if the king or that rook has been moved before
5. Castling cannot occur if the king would move through a threatened square
6. Castling cannot occur if the king is in check
7. Pawns can only advance twice if they haven't moved before
8. Pawns can capture en passant only on the move after a double advance
9. After you make the move your king may not be in check (even if you checkmate their king)
10. If 50 half-moves occur without a capture or pawn advance the game ends in stalemate
11. If neither player has sufficient pieces to checkmate the opponent the game ends in stalemate
12. If the same position occurs three times with the same player to move the game ends in stalemate
13. Pawns can promote only on the last rank
14. If no legal move can be made the game ends in stalemate
15. If no legal move can be made and the king is in check the game ends in checkmate
16. If it is your turn you must move one of your pieces (the board cannot be in the same state before and after your move)
